# Scenario Testing

This is an example plugin of how to implent custom scenarios into [FateUHC](https://fateuhc.bghddevelopment.com/). The same concept can be used for custom config items.

This shows only two of the many different ways of implenting a custom scenario, however they all use the same idea in regards to registering them. The same concept can also be used to add custom config options to FateUHC, however I am planning on adding examples for them as well.
